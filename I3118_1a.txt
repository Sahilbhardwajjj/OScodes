this shell script is an *address book management system* created using basic linux shell commands. 
it allows the user to create, view, insert, delete, modify, and search employee records stored in a text file.

important terms:
echo – used to display messages or prompts on the screen.
read – takes user input and stores it in a variable.
touch – creates an empty file.

	⁠> – appends data to the end of a file.
	⁠> cat – displays the contents of a file.
	⁠> grep – searches for a pattern in a file.
	⁠> grep -w – searches for exact word matches (like specific id).
	⁠> grep -v – shows lines that do not match the given pattern (used when deleting).
	⁠> rm – removes a file.
	⁠> mv – renames or moves files (used here to replace old file with new one).
	⁠> case...esac – conditional structure used for menu-based options.
	⁠> while loop – repeatedly displays the menu until the user chooses to exit.
	⁠> ch – variable used to store user’s choice.
	⁠> $fname – name of the address book file entered by the user.
	⁠> temp – temporary file used during delete or modify operations.

short explanation –

1.⁠ ⁠the program first asks for the name of the address book file and creates it using the touch command.
2.⁠ ⁠it then adds a header line with field names (name, id, dob, address, mobile number, salary).
3.⁠ ⁠a menu is displayed in a while loop with options (1 to 7).
4.⁠ ⁠based on the user’s choice:

   * option 1 → create multiple records and store them in the file.
   * option 2 → view all records using cat.
   * option 3 → insert a single new record.
   * option 4 → delete a record by employee id using grep and temp file.
   * option 5 → modify a record by deleting the old one and inserting a new one.
   * option 6 → search for a record by employee id using grep.
   * option 7 → exit the program (loop ends).

in short – this script is a simple command-line address book that performs basic file operations like create, view, insert, delete, modify, and search using linux shell commands and text file manipulation.
